abstract: Sleep disorders are a growing concern that affects a significant portion of the population and can lead to severe health consequences, including depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. While notable advancements have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, challenges persist in understanding their underlying mechanisms, and identifying effective interventions. The pathogenesis of sleep disorders is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of sleep disorders and identifying effective interventions is crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment. This Research Topic includes five papers that provide insight into current research on the pathogenesis and intervention of sleep disorders.
