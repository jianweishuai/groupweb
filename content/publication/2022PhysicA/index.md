abstract: The environmental temperature plays a critical role in the system functioning. In biological organisms, there often exists an optimal temperature for the most effective functions. In this work, we investigate the effect of temperature on the propagation of firing rate in a feed-forward multilayer neural network in which neurons in the first layer are stimulated by stochastic noises. We then show that the firing rate can be transmitted through the network within a temperature range. We also show that the propagation of the firing rate by synchronization is optimized at an appropriate temperature. Our findings provide new insights and improve our understanding of the optimal temperature observed in the experiments in the living biological systems.<br/> **Keywords:** Spiking neurons; Stochastic dynamical systems; Synchronization; Collective dynamics; Dynamics of networks
