abstract: Protein secondary structures have been identified as the links in the physical processes of primary sequences, typically random coils, folding into functional tertiary structures that enable proteins to involve a variety of biological events in life science. Therefore,an efficient protein secondary structure predictor is of importance especially when the structure of an amino acid sequence fragment is not solved by high-resolution experiments, such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which are usually time consuming and expensive.In this paper, a reductive deep learning model MLPRNN has been proposed to predict either 3-state or 8-state protein secondary structures. The prediction accuracy by the MLPRNN on the publicly available benchmark CB513 data set is comparable with those by other state-of-the-art models. More importantly, taking into account the reductive architecture, MLPRNN could be a baseline for future developments.
