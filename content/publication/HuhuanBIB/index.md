abstract: The proliferation of single-cell multimodal sequencing technologies has enabled us to understand cellular heterogeneity with multiple views, providing novel and actionable biological insights into the disease-driving mechanisms. Here, we propose a comprehensive end-to-end single-cell multimodal analysis framework named Deep Parametric Inference (DPI). DPI transforms single-cell multimodal data into a multimodal parameter space by inferring individual modal parameters. Analysis of cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) reveals that the multimodal parameter space can characterize the heterogeneity of cells more comprehensively than individual modalities. Furthermore, comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets show that DPI has superior performance. Additionally, DPI can reference and query cell types without batch effects. As a result, DPI can successfully analyze the progression of COVID-19 disease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Notably, we further propose a cell state vector field and analyze the transformation pattern of bone marrow cells (BMC) states. In conclusion, DPI is a powerful single-cell multimodal analysis framework that can provide new biological insights into biomedical researchers.
