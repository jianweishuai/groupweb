abstract: The next generation of artificial intelligence systems is generally governed by a new electronic element called memristor. Memristor-based computational system is responsible for confronting memory wall issues in conventional system architecture in the big data era. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS compatibility, nonvolatility and scalability are the important properties of memristor for designing such computing architecture. However, some of the concerns, such as analogue switching and stochasticity, need to be addressed for the use of memristor in novel architecture. Here, we reviewed a number of important scientific works on memristor materials, electrical performance and their integration. In addition, strategies to address the challenges of memristor integration in neuromorphic computing are also being investigated.
