abstract: It has been generally believed that both time delay and network structure could play a crucial role in determining collective dynamical behaviors in complex systems. In this work, we study the influence of coupling strength, time delay, and network topology on synchronization behavior in delay-coupled networks of chaotic pendulums. Interestingly,we find that the threshold value of the coupling strength for complete synchronization in such networks strongly depends on the time delay in the coupling, but appears to be insensitive to the network structure. This lack of sensitivity was numerically tested in several typical regular networks, such as different locally and globally coupled ones as well as in several complex networks, such as small-world and scale-free networks. Furthermore, we find that the emergence of a synchronous periodic state induced by time delay is of key importance for the complete synchronization.
