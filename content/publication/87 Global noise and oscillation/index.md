abstract: We study the effects of global noise on waves in heterogeneous, spatially clustered, reaction-diffusion systems with possible applications to calcium signaling. We first discuss how clustering of the excitability determines the dynamics by shifting bifurcation points and creating new oscillatory solutions. We then consider the specific situation, where intrinsic noise, due to the smallness of the excitable patches, destroys the global oscillatory state. We show that additional small global fluctuations, however, can partially restore temporal and spatial coherence of the oscillatory signal.
