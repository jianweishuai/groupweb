abstract: The biexponential distributions of open times are observed in various types of ion channels. In this paper, by discussing a simple channel model, we show that there are two different schemes to understand the biexponential distribution of open times. One scheme is mathematically strict based on generator matrix theory, while the other one has a clear physical explanation according to an approximation process with numerical simulation of Markovian channel dynamics. Our comparison results suggest that even for biologically complex channels, in addition to carrying out a stochastic simulation, the strict theoretical analysis should be considered to understand the multiple exponential distributions of open times.
