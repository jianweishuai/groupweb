abstract: The stimulus-dynamic response is an important topic in physics. In this work, we study the dynamics in the reaction-diffusion system subjected to a weak signal and a spatially periodic force. We find that the response of the system to the weak signal is enhanced largely by the spatially periodic force, which is termed spatially periodic-force-induced resonance. In particular, the response becomes stronger when the spatial frequency is chosen such that the system synchronizes with spatially periodic force. This combinative behavior, i.e., the spatially periodic-force-induced resonance and the spatial-synchronization-enhanced resonance, is of great interest and may shed light on our understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear systems subjected to spatially periodic force in responding to a weak signal.
