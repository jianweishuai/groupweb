abstract: In many cell types, intracellular calcium is released from internal stores through calcium release channels. Because these channels are distributed in clusters with a few tens of channels, the clusters show a strongly stochastic open and close dynamics, resulting in noisy localized Ca2+ signals called puffs. Using the Li-Rinzel model we compare the stochastic channel simulations for the Markov method and three different Langevin approaches. We suggest that a modified Langevin approach should be considered in order to more accurately simulate Markov channel noise for puff dynamics.
