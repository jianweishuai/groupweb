abstract: We introduce a “gradient” to find out the defectors, and further a “topology potential” to characterize the individual’s strategy preference in the prisoner’s dilemma on scale-free networks. It is shown that the cooperators typically locate on the nodes with high topology potential and the defectors are mainly found on the nodes with small topology potential. A critical topology potential is found for the nodes where cooperators are nip and tuck with defectors. So the information of node’s degree, gradient and topology potential together can predict individual’s strategy decision in the prisoner’s dilemma on the complex networks.
