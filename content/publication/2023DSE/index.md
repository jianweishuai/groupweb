abstract: User-generated content is daily produced in social media, as such user interest summarization is critical to distill salient information from massive information for recommendation tasks. While the interested messages (e.g., tags or posts) from a single user are usually sparse becoming a bottleneck for existing methods, we propose a neural inference method (NIGraphNet) by mining user social interest for item recommendation. It can unearth user latent topics combined with user relation learning. Specifically, we exploit a neural variational inference approach to learn the distributions between user interests and hidden topics. (We denote it as interest-topic distributions in the following.) Then, we adopt a unified graph-based training loss that jointly learns the hidden topics and user relations for item recommendation. Experiments on two datasets collected from well-known social media platforms demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the tasks of user interest summarization and item recommendation. Further discussions also show that exploiting the latent topic representations and user relations is conducive to the userâ€™s automatic language understanding.
