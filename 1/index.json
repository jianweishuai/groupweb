However, identification of trait-relevant cell populations is often impeded by inherent technical noise and high sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Here, we developed scPagwas, a computational approach that uncovers trait-relevant cellular context by integrating pathway activation transformation of scRNA-seq data and GWAS summary statistics. scPagwas effectively prioritizes trait-relevant genes, which facilitates identification of trait-relevant cell types/populations with high accuracy in extensive simulated and real datasets. Cellular-level association results identified a novel subpopulation of naive CD8+ T cells related to COVID-19 severity and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell and microglia subsets with critical pathways by which genetic variants influence Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, our approach provides new insights for the discovery of trait-relevant cell types and improves the mechanistic understanding of disease variants from a pathway perspective.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Polygenic regression uncovers trait-relevant cellular contexts through pathway activation transformation of single-cell RNA sequencing data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoman Chen","Hui Ye","Fanxuan Chen","Yi Shi","Jiahe Li","Yuhang Li","Chaoyi Wei","Chengxi Zhang","Jinhao Jin","Quanyue Zhang","Shuo Pan","Dong Chen","Shichao Quan","Xiaowei Xu","Zongxing Yang","Lijun Xu","Yungui Zhang","Yi Wang","Yunlong Zhou","Ou Liu","Xiaoming Jiang","Liyu Liu","Qingzu He","Xiaoqu Hu","Jingye Pan","Jianwei Shuai","Feifei Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693180800,"objectID":"31b35d62633b5fc80a5806a7db2ff84f","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023ais%E6%B5%A9%E6%BB%A1/","publishdate":"2023-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023ais%E6%B5%A9%E6%BB%A1/","section":"publication","summary":"The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates challenges faced by human immunodeficiency virus patients, who are at heightened risk for infection due to compromised immune systems. This study aims to develop a reliable, home-based point-of-care testing (POCT) tool for early screening of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) coinfected with Talaromyces marneffei infection. Employing a “From weak to strong” deduction strategy for feature selection, data from 464 AIDS patients across four cohorts between February 5th, 2014, and January 8th, 2022, are analyzed. The top three features consistently observed are D-dimer, cluster of differentiation 4+, and aspartate transaminase. Based on these features, the simplest risk-scoring model is constructed, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.69 in the hold-out cohort, external cohort 1, and external cohort 2, respectively. This “From weak to strong” deduction strategy identifies advantageous clinical features, enabling the development of simplified clinical risk scores with multiple biomarkers. To facilitate practical implementation, enhanced POCT tools are introduced, specifically a strip with segmented testing capabilities that demonstrates sensitivity and strong correlation with clinical scoring models. Furthermore, an open-access website and a free Android mobile app are created to support community utilization. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the innovative deduction strategy and enhanced test strips, which enable bedside measurements without laboratory dependency.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Revolutionizing Infection Risk Scoring: An Ensemble “From Weak to Strong” Deduction Strategy and Enhanced Point-of-Care Testing Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jilu Wang","Aiai Shi","Jie Lyu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1692230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692230400,"objectID":"87c0d9531c7b4dd939b0878b6cd4d3af","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023lv/","publishdate":"2023-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023lv/","section":"publication","summary":"Epigenetic machinery contributes to gene regulation in eukaryotic species. However, the machinery including more than 600 epigenetic regulator (ER) genes responsible for reading, writing, and erasing histone modifications and DNA modifications remains largely uncharacterized across species. We compile a comprehensive list of ERs based on an evolutionary analysis across 23 species, which is the most comprehensive ER list in various species until recently. We further perform comparative transcriptomic analyses across different tissues in humans, mice, as well as other amniote species. We observe a consistent tissue-of-origin expression specificity pattern of duplicated ER genes across species and suggest links between expression specificity and ER gene evolution as well as ER function. Additional analyses further suggest that ER duplication can generate tissue-specific ER genes with the same epigenetic substrates, which may be closely related to their regulatory specificity in tissue development. Our work can serve as a foundation to better comprehend the tissue-specific expression patterns of ER genes from an evolutionary perspective and also the functional implications of ERs in tissue-specific epigenetic regulation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A comprehensive atlas of epigenetic regulators reveals tissue-specific epigenetic regulation patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianzhu Hu","Yong Zhang","Jiaqi Yan","Ou Liu","Huaiqing Wang","Xiangqun Cui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1692230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692230400,"objectID":"86fe961fc5ffdf90445190ecbec4d5a1","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/mnras2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/mnras2023/","section":"publication","summary":"The imaging quality of a telescope directly affects the reliability of astronomical research. Through the monitoring and diagnosis of imaging quality, the cause of the deterioration of imaging quality can be found in time, which is essential for ensuring the peaking performance of the telescope and high-quality imaging. Moreover, these operations are complex and crucial for achieving high-quality imaging of future giant telescope systems involving active optics, adaptive optics, and other advanced techniques. We propose a three-component method based on cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to real-time monitor and efficiently diagnose the telescope image quality. The first component, an image quality monitoring system, monitors and outputs the telescope’s image quality.

While the interested messages (e.g., tags or posts) from a single user are usually sparse becoming a bottleneck for existing methods, we propose a neural inference method (NIGraphNet) by mining user social interest for item recommendation. It can unearth user latent topics combined with user relation learning. Specifically, we exploit a neural variational inference approach to learn the distributions between user interests and hidden topics. (We denote it as interest-topic distributions in the following.) Then, we adopt a unified graph-based training loss that jointly learns the hidden topics and user relations for item recommendation. Experiments on two datasets collected from well-known social media platforms demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the tasks of user interest summarization and item recommendation. Further discussions also show that exploiting the latent topic representations and user relations is conducive to the user’s automatic language understanding.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Neural Inference of User Social Interest for Item Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongyan Gao","Jianqiang Sun","Yukun Wang","Yuer Lu","Liyu Liu","Qi Zhao","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690243200,"objectID":"5f843b3d08ea6b53c4bd60fbf66d9116","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023-bib-2/","publishdate":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023-bib-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Metabolism refers to a series of orderly chemical reactions used to maintain life activities in organisms. In healthy individuals, metabolism remains within a normal range. However, specific diseases can lead to abnormalities in the levels of certain metabolites, causing them to either increase or decrease. Detecting these deviations in metabolite levels can aid in diagnosing a disease. Traditional biological experiments often rely on a lot of manpower to do repeated experiments, which is time consuming and labor intensive. To address this issue, we develop a deep learning model based on the auto-encoder and non-negative matrix factorization named as MDA-AENMF to predict the potential associations between metabolites and diseases. We integrate a variety of similarity networks and then acquire the characteristics of both metabolites and diseases through three specific modules. First, we get the disease characteristics from the five-layer auto-encoder module. Later, in the non-negative matrix factorization module, we extract both the metabolite and disease characteristics. Furthermore, the graph attention auto-encoder module helps us obtain metabolite characteristics. After obtaining the features from three modules, these characteristics are merged into a single, comprehensive feature vector for each metabolite-disease pair. Finally, we send the corresponding feature vector and label to the multi-layer perceptron for training. The experiment demonstrates our area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.975 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.973 in 5-fold cross-validation, which are superior to those of existing state-of-the-art predictive methods. Through case studies, most of the new associations obtained by MDA-AENMF have been verified, further highlighting the reliability of MDA-AENMF in predicting the potential relationships between metabolites and diseases.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Predicting metabolite–disease associations based on auto-encoder and non-negative matrix factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenggui Yao","JianQiang Sun","Jun Jin","Jianwei Shuai","Xiang Li","Yuangen Yao","Xufan Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690070400,"objectID":"26668be7e69a982d11d75eb148dbd6ad","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023chaossf%E5%A7%9A/","publishdate":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023chaossf%E5%A7%9A/","section":"publication","summary":"Information encoding and decoding by neurons is a fundamental process in neuroscience.

Previous research has demonstrated that the absence of orexin (Orx) can trigger narcolepsy, a condition characterized by frequent shifts between wakefulness and sleep. However, the specific mechanisms and temporal patterns through which Orx regulates wakefulness/sleep are not fully understood. In this study, we developed a new model that combines the classical Phillips-Robinson sleep model with the Orx network. Our model incorporates a recently discovered indirect inhibition of Orx on sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. By integrating appropriate physiological parameters, our model successfully replicated the dynamic behavior of normal sleep under the influence of circadian drive and homeostatic processes. Furthermore, our results from the new sleep model unveiled two distinct effects of Orx excitation of wake-active neurons and inhibition of sleep-active neurons. The excitation effect helps to sustain wakefulness, while the inhibition effect contributes to arousal, consistent with experimental findings [De Luca et al., Nat. Commun. 13, 4163 (2022)]. Moreover, we utilized the theory of potential landscapes to investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the frequent transitions observed in narcolepsy. The topography of the underlying landscape delineated the brain's capacity to transition between different states. Additionally, we examined the impact of Orx on barrier height. Our analysis demonstrated that a reduced level of Orx led to a bistable state with an extremely low threshold, contributing to the development of narcoleptic sleep disorder.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A physical understanding and quantification for the regulation of orexin on sleep","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Hu","Zhen Feng","Xinghao Steven Shuai","Jie Lyu","Xiang Li","Hai Lin","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688947200,"objectID":"e111d621764e50f84d28db75d0d58764","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023fim%E8%83%A1%E6%A1%93/","publishdate":"2023-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023fim%E8%83%A1%E6%A1%93/","section":"publication","summary":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and identifying cell types in virus-related research.

Recent vision transformers have shown promising performance in handling the variation through global con text modeling. Still, they have not thoroughly solved the problem of ambiguous boundaries as they ignore the com plementary usage of the boundary knowledge and global contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-scale boundary-aware transformer, XBound-Former, to simulta neously address the variation and boundary problems of skin lesion segmentation. XBound-Former is a purely attention-based network and catches boundary knowledge via three specially designed learners. First, we propose an implicit boundary learner (im-Bound) to constrain the network attention on the points with noticeable bound ary variation, enhancing the local context modeling while maintaining the global context.

Unlike simple radiation damage to other organs, radiation proctitis is a complex disease closely related to the microbiota. However, analysis of the gut microbiota is time-consuming and expensive. This study aims to mine rectal information using radiomics and incorporate it into a nomogram model for cheap and fast prediction of severe radiation proctitis prediction in postoperative cervical cancer patients. **Methods:** The severity of the patient’s radiation proctitis was graded according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria. The toxicity grade of radiation proctitis over or equal to grade 2 was set as the model’s target. A total of 178 patients with cervical cancer were divided into a training set (n = 124) and a validation set (n = 54). Multivariate logistic regression was used to build the radiomic and non-raidomic models. **Results:** The radiomics model [AUC=0.6855(0.5174-0.8535)] showed better performance and more net benefit in the validation set than the non radiomic model [AUC=0.6641(0.4904-0.8378)]. In particular, we applied SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method for the first time to a radiomics based logistic regression model to further interpret the radiomic features from case-based and feature-based perspectives. The integrated radiomic model enables the first accurate quantitative assessment of the probability of radiation proctitis in postoperative cervical cancer patients, addressing the limitations of the current qualitative assessment of the plan through dose volume parameters only.","tags":[null],"title":"Development and validation of an interpretable radiomic nomogram for severe radiation proctitis prediction in postoperative cervical cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Xu","Dingyang Miao","Wei Li","Jun Jin","Zhilong Liu","Chuansheng Shen","Jiqian Zhang","Jianwei Shuai","Xiang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673308800,"objectID":"29fe8513a1b97ba4331dcf38c1f18bb3","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023prr%E5%BE%90%E9%A3%9E/","publishdate":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023prr%E5%BE%90%E9%A3%9E/","section":"publication","summary":"Phase separation is a ubiquitous and emerging mechanism underlying intracellular organization. Yet how distinct molecular compositions in phase-separated condensates are established and what prohibits these condensates from randomly fusing together remain largely unanswered. Here, through proposing a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model paired with Ginzburg-Landau free-energy scheme, we explored how compositions are assembled in messenger RNAs (mRNAs)-driven protein droplets with respect to distinct physical properties. By analyzing the intradroplet heteropatterning of two specific droplets mRNA-driven Whi3 droplets), we demonstrated that the growth rate of droplet size and higher-order complexes assembly in droplet are severally determined by the diffusion rate of droplet and the binding rate of mRNA with protein. While considering the three-species mixed system of two mRNAs that share a common binding protein, the two specific droplets preferentially assemble separately rather than colocalize. We found the two droplets compete with each other by snatching the protein that has been recruited into the other droplet when the free protein is insufficient. Further analysis dissects that the gradient–interfacial energy coefficients, initial mRNAs levels, and mRNAs-protein binding rates can efficiently shift the spatial patterns of the two specific droplets from segregation to the shared interface or enclosed patterns. All three patterns obtained by tuning the initial mRNAs levels or mRNA-protein binding rates have been experimentally observed. Another unreported core-shell pattern is predicted by synergistically reducing the gradient and interfacial energy coefficients. Our findings shed light on the establishment of intradroplet compositions in condensates with distinct physical properties and the general control mechanisms of phase-separated pattern formation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Specificity and competition of mRNAs dominate droplet pattern in protein phase separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["袁钦湄","杨峘","张骏","刘博雯","帅建伟","曹玉萍"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"2aaca0c4025ea17ce0a5014956b61f82","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2023emotional/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2023emotional/","section":"publication","summary":"探索基于深度学习算法的抑郁症患者表情动作变化与其症状转归及内在心理整合的关系。**方法:** 采集1例抑郁症患者14次认知行为治疗的全程音视频资料，使用汉密尔顿抑郁量表（HAMD）与汉密尔顿焦虑量表 （HAMA）评估病情，采用深度学习算法分析患者的表情熵、表情成分和动作幅度，采用整合分析方法评估患者的问 题体验整合顺序（APES）。 **结果:** 治疗前后患者HAMD与HAMA减分率分别为90.91%和91.43%。随治疗进行，患者 表情熵值呈现波动式上升，抑郁表情出现的概率总体呈降低趋势，整体动作幅度逐渐增高，语量逐渐增加。患者最 初APES评分0分，治疗结束时APES评分为7分。结论：基于深度学习算法的抑郁症外显的表情与动作变化，与其 内在的心理整合变化呈现一致性。将深度学习算法应用于抑郁症患者的表情识别和姿势评估是可行的。","tags":[null],"title":"基于深度学习算法的抑郁症表情与动作及其心理整合变化的过程分析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Qu","Chunlei Shao","Yongfa Ying","Yuning Wu","Wen Liu","Yuhua Tian","Zhiyong Yin","Xiang Li","Zhengquan Yu","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670284800,"objectID":"52fdef6e73e11dff3f29b3a99440dc44","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2022-jing-qu/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2022-jing-qu/","section":"publication","summary":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory disorders caused by the disruption of immune tolerance to the gut microbiota. MicroRNA-31 (MIR31) has been proven to be up-regulated in intestinal tissues from patients with IBDs and colitis-associated neoplasias. While the functional role of MIR31 in colitis and related diseases remain elusive. Combining mathematical modeling and experimental analysis, we systematically explored the regulatory mechanism of MIR31 in inflammatory and epithelial regeneration responses in colitis. Level of MIR31 presents an “adaptation” behavior in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and the similar behavior is also observed for the key cytokines of p65 and STAT3. Simulation analysis predicts MIR31 suppresses the activation of p65 and STAT3 but accelerates the recovery of epithelia in colitis, which are validated by our experimental observations. Further analysis reveals that the number of proliferative epithelial cells, which characterizes the inflammatory process and the recovery of epithelia in colitis, is mainly determined by the inhibition of MIR31 on IL17RA. MIR31 promotes epithelial regeneration in low levels of DSS-induced colitis but inhibits inflammation with high DSS levels, which is dominated by the competition for MIR31 to either inhibit inflammation or promote epithelial regeneration by binding to different targets. The binding probability determines the functional transformation of MIR31, but the functional strength is determined by MIR31 levels. Thus, the role of MIR31 in the inflammatory response can be described as the “spring like effect,” where DSS, MIR31 action strength, and proliferative epithelial cell number are regarded as external force, intrinsic spring force, and spring length, respectively. Overall, our study uncovers the vital roles of MIR31 in balancing inflammation and the recovery of epithelia in colitis, providing potential clues for the development of therapeutic targets in drug design.","tags":[null],"title":"The spring-like effect of microRNA-31 in balancing inflammatory and regenerative responses in colitis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongdong Liu","Bowen Liu","Tao Lin","Guangya Liu","Guoyu Yang","Dezhen Qi","Ye Qiu","Yuer Lu","Qinmei Yuan","Stella C.

In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are mainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly depends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning methods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most of the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however, in recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better prediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop a measurement of depression severity from expression and action features and to assess its validity among the patients with MDD. **Methods：** We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which was based on the detection of patients’ facial expression and body movement from videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral depression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and action entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients.**Results：** We found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This method presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and selfrating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS),depression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes of BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results obtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales. **Discussion:** The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients’depression and its changing trend according to the patient’s expression and action features.

Numerous research studies have proven that although lncRNAs cannot be directly translated into proteins, lncRNAs still play an important role in human growth processes by interacting with proteins. Since traditional biological experiments often require a lot of time and material costs to explore potential lncRNA–protein interactions (LPI), several computational models have been proposed for this task. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning method known as combined graph auto-encoders (LPICGAE) to predict potential human LPIs. First, we apply a variational graph auto-encoder to learn the low dimensional representations from the high-dimensional features of lncRNAs and proteins. Then the graph auto-encoder is used to reconstruct the adjacency matrix for inferring potential interactions between lncRNAs and proteins. Finally, we minimize the loss of the two processes alternately to gain the final predicted interaction matrix. The result in 5-fold cross-validation experiments illustrates that our method achieves an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.974 and an average accuracy of 0.985, which is better than those of existing six state-of-the-art computational methods.

Previous models for these intriguing natural optical phenomena suggested the combined action of two populations of guanine crystals with an orthogonal low-refractive-index optic axis. Here we report a novel realization of polarization-insensitive broadband reflectivity in a spider, Phoroncidia rubroargentea, based solely on the type of guanine crystals with the low-refractive-index optic axis normal to the crystal plates. We examined the three-dimensional structure of the guanine assembly in the spider and performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical modeling of the guanine-based multilayer reflector. Comparative modeling studies reveal that the biological selection of the guanine crystal type and specific spatial arrangement work synergistically to optimize the polarization-insensitive broadband reflection. This study demonstrates the importance of both crystallographic characteristics and 3D arrangement of guanine crystals in understanding relevant natural optical effects and also provides new insights into similar broadband, low-polarizing reflections in biological optical systems.

Mounting evidence accumulates that inflammasome signaling is highly correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of inflammasome signaling. Combining mathematical modeling with experimental analysis of NLRP1b inflammasome signaling, we found that only the expression levels of caspase-1 and GSDMD have the potential to individually switch cell death modes. Reduction of caspase-1 or GSDMD switches cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis. Caspase-1 and GSDMD present different thresholds and exert distinct pathway choices in switching death modes. Pyroptosis switches to apoptosis with an extremely low threshold level of caspase-1, but with a high threshold of GSDMD. Caspase-1-impaired cells employ ASC-caspase-8-dependent pathway for apoptosis, while GSDMD-impaired cells primarily utilize caspase-1-dependent pathway. Additionally, caspase-1 and GSDMD can severally ignite the cooccurrence of pyroptosis and apoptosis. Landscape topography unravels that the cooccurrence is dramatically different in caspase-1- and GSDMD-impaired cells. Besides pyroptosis state and apoptosis state, a potential new \"coexisting\" state in single cells is proposed when GSDMD acts as the driving force of the landscape. The \"seesaw model\" is therefore proposed, which can well describe the death states that are controlled by caspase-1 or GSDMD in single cells. Our study sheds new light on NLRP1b inflammasome signaling and uncovers the switching mechanisms among various death modes, providing potential clues to guide the development of more rational control strategies for diseases.","tags":[null],"title":"Caspase-1 and Gasdermin D Afford the Optimal Targets with Distinct Switching Strategies in NLRP1b Inflammasome-Induced Cell Death","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Hu","Ruiqi Liu","Chunlin Zhao","Yuer Lu","Yichun Xiong","Lingling Chen","Jun Jin","Yunlong Ma","Jianzhong Su","Zhengquan Yu","Feng Cheng","Fangfu Ye","Liyu Liu","Qi Zhao","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"331ce30c10b702bc4c10f7c68c1e3141","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2022rnab/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2022rnab/","section":"publication","summary":"Simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities in single-cell analysis, represented by CITE-seq, is a promising approach to link transcriptional changes to cellular phenotype and function, requiring new computational methods to define cellular subtypes and states based on multiple data types.

To further validate the robustness of the CITEMO framework, we analyse Human Bone Marrow Cell (HBMC) samples and identify different states of the same cell type.

Although the output of OpenSWATH is controlled at 1% false discovery rate (FDR), the output report still contains many peptide precursors with low similarity fragments. At the last step of OpenSWATH for peptide quantification, researchers usually need to manually check the similarity of the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of fragments to distinguish the high confidence and the low confidence peptide precursors. Here we developed an algorithm with a Graphic User Interface named MSSort-DIAXMBD, which combines the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the double-threshold segmentation process, to automatically recognize the high confidence precursors and low confidence precursors. To train the model of MSSort-DIAXMBD, we built a database contained about 50,000 manually classified peptide precursors acquired from different instrument platforms and different species. With the double-threshold segmentation strategy, MSSort-DIAXMBD can reduce the number of the low confidence peptides required for manual inspections to less than 10% and be used as the last step of OpenSWATH to visualize and classify the MS/MS data of peptide precursors. **SIGNIFICANCE:** Although the output of OpenSWATH is controlled at 1% false discovery rate (FDR), the output report still contains many peptide precursors with low similarity fragments. At the last step of OpenSWATH for peptide quantification, researchers usually need to manually check the similarity of fragment XICs to distinguish the high confidence and the low confidence peptide precursors. However, manual inspection is inefficient. For instance, it takes about 50 h to sort even a small dataset of 1000 MS/MS spectra manually. In this paper we developed a software named MSSort-DIAXMBD to automatically recognize the high confidence precursors.

Most recently, mounting evidence accumulates that pyroptotic signaling is highly correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, understanding the induction of the pyroptotic signaling and dissecting the detail molecular control mechanisms are urgently needed. Based on recent experimental studies, a core reg ulatory model of the pyroptotic signaling is constructed to investigate the intricate crosstalk dynamics between the two cell death types, i.e., pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. The model well reproduces the experimental observations under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis determines that only the expression level of caspase-1 or GSDMD has the potential to individually change death modes. The de crease of caspase-1 or GSDMD level switches cell death from pyroptosis to secondary pyroptosis. Be sides, eight biochemical reactions are identified that can efficiently switch death modes. While from the viewpoint of bifurcation analysis, the expression level of caspase-3 is further identified and twelve bio chemical reactions are obtained. The coexistence of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis is predicted to be observed not only within the bistable range, but also within proper monostable range, presenting two potential different control mechanisms. Combined with the landscape theory, we further explore the stochastic dynamic and global stability of the pyroptotic system, accurately quantifying how each compo nent mediates the individual occurrence probability of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. Overall, this study sheds new light on the intricate crosstalk of the pyroptotic signaling and uncovers the regulatory mechanisms of various stable state transitions, providing potential clues to guide the development for prevention and treatment of pyroptosis-related diseases","tags":[null],"title":"Network modeling-based identification of the switching targets between pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohanbabu Bharathi","Babu Balraj","Chandrasekar Sivakumar","Zhiwei Wang","Jianwei Shuai","Mon-Shu Ho","Donghui Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637107200,"objectID":"d2de8073a1dfc380c764eb7af229b98f","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2021jac/","publishdate":"2021-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2021jac/","section":"publication","summary":"As an emerging technology, nanoscale non-volatile memory technology can be used for in-memory computing and neuromorphic computing.

However, whether and how oscillation behavior is involved and required for necroptosis remain elusive. To address this question, a minimal necroptotic circuit is proposed based on the CNS pathway. Stochastic parameter analysis demonstrates that the essential structure for oscillation of the CNS circuit is constituted by a paradoxical component embedded with positive feedback among the three protein nodes, i.e., RIP1,caspase-8, and RIP3. Distribution characteristics of all parameters in the CNS circuit with stable oscillation are investigated as well, and a unidirectional bias with fast and slow dynamics that are required for high occurrence probability of oscillation is identified. Four types of oscillation behaviors are classified and their robustness is further explored,implying that the fast oscillation behavior is more robust than the slow behavior. In addition, bifurcation analysis and landscape approach are employed to study stochastic dynamics and global stability of the circuit oscillations, revealing the possible switching strategies among different behaviors. Taken together, our study provides a natural and physical bases for understanding the occurrence of oscillations in the necroptotic network, advancing our knowledge of oscillations in regulating the various cell death signaling.","tags":[null],"title":"Oscillations Governed by the Incoherent Dynamics in Necroptotic Signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyong Yin","Pei-pei Zhang","Fei Xu","Zhilong Liu","Ligang Zhu","Jun Jin","Hong Qi","Jianwei Shuai","Xiang Li","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629158400,"objectID":"6af1c04fc69505cc9a6a9bf6407ae3c0","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2021chaos/","publishdate":"2021-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2021chaos/","section":"publication","summary":"The crosstalk between pyroptosis and apoptosis pathways plays crucial roles in homeostasis, cancer, and other pathologies.

Monostability, bistability, and tristability are observed under different conditions. We found that only the reaction that caspase-1 activation induced by stimuli can trigger tristability. Six and two of the nine reactions are identified to be able to induce bistability and monostability, respectively.

Here, we convert the mechanisms into a set of ordinary differential equations. We firstly simulate the time evolution of Ca2+ concentration under two different levels of Bcl-2 for the direct and indirect mechanism models and compare them with experimental results available in the literature. Secondly, we employ one- and two-parameter bifurcation analysis to demonstrate that Bcl-2 can suppress Ca2+ signal from a global point of view both in the direct and indirect mechanism models. We then use mathematical analysis to clarify that the indirect mechanism is more efficient than the direct mechanism in repressing Ca2+ signal. Lastly, we predict that the two mechanisms restrict Ca2+ signal synergistically.

Cell migration is typically modeled as a persistent random walk, which depends on two critical motility parameters, i.e., migration speed and persistence time. It is generally very challenging to efficiently and accurately quantify the migration dynamics from noisy experimental data. Here, we introduce the normalized Shannon entropy (SE) based on the FPS of cellular velocity autocovariance function to quantify migration dynamics.The SE introduced here possesses a similar physical interpretation as the Gibbs entropy for thermal systems in that SE naturally reflects the degree of order or randomness of cellular migration, attaining the maximal value of unity for purely diffusive migration (i.e., SE ¼ 1 for the most ‘‘random’’ dynamics) and the minimal value of 0 for purely ballistic dynamics (i.e., SE ¼ 0 for the most ‘‘ordered’’ dynamics). We also find that SE is strongly correlated with the migration persistence but is less sensitive to the migrattion speed. Moreover, we introduce the time-varying SE based on the WPS of cellular dynamics and demonstrate its superior utility to characterize the time-dependent persistence of cell migration, which typically results from complex and time-varying intra- or extracellular mechanisms. We employ our approach to analyze experimental data of in vitro cell migration regulated by distinct intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, exhibiting a rich spectrum of dynamic characteristics. Our analysis indicates that the SE and wavelet transform (i.e., SE-based approach) offers a simple and efficient tool to quantify cell migration dynamics in complex microenvironment.","tags":[null],"title":"Shannon entropy for time-varying persistence of cell migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiangyu Qian","Ye Qiu","Qingzu He","Yuer Lu","Hai Lin","Fei Xu","Fangfang Zhu","Zhilong Liu","Xiang Li","Yuping Cao","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623628800,"objectID":"32e5775127359773bb5b40457b3e78ff","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2021brainsci/","publishdate":"2021-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2021brainsci/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed DreamDIAXMBD (denoted as DreamDIA), a software suite based on a deep representation model for data-independent acquisition (DIA) data analysis.

PhoP is a response regulator, which serves as a transcription factor under a phosphorylation-dependent modulation by PhoQ, a histidine kinase. **Results :** Our model reveals two major signaling pathways to modulate the phosphorylated PhoP (P-PhoP) level, one of which promotes the generation of P-PhoP, while the other depresses the level of P-PhoP. The competition beetween the P-PhoP-promoting and the P-PhoP-depressing pathways determines the generation of the P-PhoP surge.Furthermore, besides PhoQ, PhoP is also a bifunctional modulator that contributes to the dynamic control of P-PhoP state, leading to a biphasic regulation of the surge by the gene feedback loop. In summary, the mechanisms derived from the PhoP/PhoQ system for the transcriptional surges provide a better understanding on such a sophisticatedsignal transduction system and aid to develop new antimicrobial strategies targeting TCSs.","tags":[null],"title":"Biphasic regulation of transcriptional surge generated by the gene feedback loop in a two-component system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuning Wu","Qin Wang","Jing Qu","Wen Liu","Xuejuan Gao","Xiang Li","Xinhao Ouyang","Chentao Lin","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"1ef0bc0aeb73cb138eaffba4728dc67f","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2021plantce/","publishdate":"2021-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2021plantce/","section":"publication","summary":"1","tags":[null],"title":"Different response modes and cooperation modulations of blue-light receptors in photomorphogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Li","Chuan-Qi Zhong","Rui Wu","Zhang-Hua Yang","Shaowei Cai","Xiurong Wu","Xin Chen","Zhiyong Yin","Qingzu He","Dianjie Li","Fei Xu","Yihua Yan","Hong Qi","Changchuan Xie","Jianwei Shuai","Jiahuai Han"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610841600,"objectID":"7fa0fdd3e024a119df4478559d5c9058","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/2021proteincell/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/2021proteincell/","section":"publication","summary":"1","tags":[null],"title":"RIP1-dependent linear and nonlinear recruitments of caspase-8 and RIP3 respectively to necrosome specify distinct cell death outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

The correlation between the pretreatment T790M mutation status and clinical outcomes was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.**Results:** Pretreatment T790M mutation was reported in 1.39% of the patients and coexisted with an EGFR-activating or uncommon mutation. The dual EGFR T790M and common EGFR-activating mutations were more likely to be detected in lung adenocarcinoma,whereas single T790M mutation was more prevalent in non-adenocarcinomas. The presence of de novo T790M mutation correlated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with NSCLC (odds ratio [OR] 3.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67–6.79, P =0.001).

The mechanism of the detection may be understood by the vibrational resonance, in which the moderate intensity of high-frequency force can amplify the response of neuronal systems to the low-frequency signal. In this paper, the effects of electrical and chemical autapses on signal transmission are investigated in scale-free and small-world neuronal networks, where an external two-frequency signal is introduced only to one neuron as a pacemaker. We observed that the inhibitory autapse can significantly enhance the signal propagation by the vibrational resonance, while the electrical and excitatory autapses typically weaken the signal transmission, indicating that the inhibitory autapse is more beneficial to transmit the rhythm of the pacemaker to the whole networks. These findings contribute to our understanding of signal detection and information processing in the autapic neuronal system.","tags":[null],"title":"Poor Prognosis With Coexistence Of EGFR T790M Mutation And Common EGFR-Activating Mutation In Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi He","Ling Xiong","Xuejuan Gao","Miaomiao Hai","Yanping Liu","Gao Wang","Guo Chen","Jianwei Shuai","Yang Jiao","Xixiang Zhang","Ruchuan Liu","Liyu Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568851200,"objectID":"edf4d50ae44df8cce8cecf40cb7b70b1","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/165-morphological/","publishdate":"2019-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/165-morphological/","section":"publication","summary":"Metastasis determines the lethality of cancer.

Further, this approach could potentially become a speedy (∼hours) and efficient tool for basic and clinical diagnosis.","tags":[null],"title":"Quantitative heterogeneity and subgroup classification based on motility of breast cancer cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐富献","王抒伟","钱镶钰","胡 桓","何情祖","林 海","帅建伟"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565481600,"objectID":"a04f3532ed54f1be0461bc51d76ffe31","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/154-%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E5%88%86%E6%9C%9F%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E7%BB%BC%E8%BF%B0.-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6/","publishdate":"2019-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/154-%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E5%88%86%E6%9C%9F%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E7%BB%BC%E8%BF%B0.-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6/","section":"publication","summary":"睡眠是人体必不可少的一项生理活动。通常，专家将病人整夜的脑电EEG数据以30秒为一帧进行睡眠状态分期并据此进行睡眠状态的分析与评估。然而，依靠人工标记睡眠数据需要消耗大量的精力。另一方面，专家的主观判断也会对分期结果带来误差。所以睡眠的自动分期就变得很重要，本文将介绍近年来的睡眠分期方法，分别是基于统计规则分期方法与基于深度学习技术的分期法。在统计的分期方法中，介绍了三个重要的过程，预处理、特征提取以及分类器的选择。在基于深度学习的分期方法中，介绍了多层神经网络、卷积神经网络、长短时记忆神经网络以及不同网络组合的神经网络。最后我们对睡眠分期的研究进行了讨论, 认为深度神经网络将是未来睡眠分期研究主要方法。","tags":[null],"title":"睡眠自动分期方法综述","type":"publication"},{"authors":["尤欢欢","张少杰","林 海","钱镶玉","何情祖","胡 桓","屈 静","熊富海","帅建伟"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"9f294a62317b299c1c5d6c13bccd60e0","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/162-%E9%AA%A8%E7%A7%91%E5%BA%B7%E5%A4%8D%E5%8C%BB%E7%96%97%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%9B%BE%E8%B0%B1%E5%BB%BA%E7%AB%8B%E5%8F%8A%E5%85%B6%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/","publishdate":"2019-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/162-%E9%AA%A8%E7%A7%91%E5%BA%B7%E5%A4%8D%E5%8C%BB%E7%96%97%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%9B%BE%E8%B0%B1%E5%BB%BA%E7%AB%8B%E5%8F%8A%E5%85%B6%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/","section":"publication","summary":"知识图谱作为知识的结构化表示，已成为智能认知系统的一个重要研究方向。本文主要通过抓取网络上以骨科康复治疗知识为主的各种医学知识，通过数据清洗将这些医学数据整合成以疾病为中心的结构化知识。同时辅助权威书籍和医生专家对数据进行修正和增删。最终将数据存入图数据库，构建七类约9.6万的实体节点、十类约109万的实体关系以及九类属性类型的医疗健康知识图谱。本文进一步对构建的知识图谱进行通用疾病和骨科疾病分析，发现实体关系边数分布满足幂律分布，同时分析了各类型实体关系边数排行榜，为病人食谱、症状、检查项目和并发症等选择提供一定的参考价值，本知识图谱也为骨科康复的互联网远程智能问诊打下基础。","tags":[null],"title":"Classification of Sleep Apnea with Artificial Intelligence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["袁钦湄","王星","帅建伟","林海","曹玉萍"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563062400,"objectID":"2fd240ea69783834a230fafb52857e0e","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/161-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%8A%91%E9%83%81%E7%97%87%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%95.-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%B8%B4%E5%BA%8A%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6%E6%9D%82%E5%BF%97/","publishdate":"2019-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/161-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%8A%91%E9%83%81%E7%97%87%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%95.-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%B8%B4%E5%BA%8A%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6%E6%9D%82%E5%BF%97/","section":"publication","summary":"人工智能已尝试应用于临床医学各领域。作为最常见的精神疾病之一，抑郁症近来成为研究热点。本文综述人工智能相关技术在抑郁症中的应用，包括基于人工智能的声学特征、脑电和生理生化信息及脑影像学分析等抑郁症识别和辅助诊断方法，及其在抑郁症预警和干预方面的应用，并讨论其优势、不足与展望。","tags":[null],"title":"基于人工智能技术的抑郁症研究进展","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi He","Ling Xiong","Xuejuan Gao","Miaomiao Hai","Yanping Liu","Gao Wang","Guo Chen","Jianwei Shuai","Yang Jiao","Xixiang Zhang","Ruchuan Liu","Liyu Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560902400,"objectID":"81d571499b7f054a9eeb0420086bc674","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/164-quantitative-modeling/","publishdate":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/164-quantitative-modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"Quorum sensing (QS) refers to the cell communication through signaling molecules that regulate many important biological functions of bacteria by monitoring their population density. Although a wide spectrum of studies on the QS system mechanisms have been carried out in experiments, mathematical modeling to explore the QS system has become a powerful approach as well. In this paper, we review the research progress of network modeling in bacterial QS to capture the system’s underlying mechanisms. There are four types of QS system models for bacteria the Gram-negative QS system model, the Gram-positive QS system model, the model for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive QS system, and the synthetic QS system model. These QS system models are mostly described by the ordinary differential equations (ODE)or partial differential equations (PDE) to study the changes of signaling molecule dynamics in time and space and the cell population density variations. Besides the deterministic simulations, the stochastic modeling approaches have also been introduced to discuss the noise effects on kinetics in QS systems. Taken together, these current modeling efforts advance our understanding of the QS system by providing systematic and quantitative dynamics description, which can hardly be obtained in experiments.","tags":[null],"title":"Morphological quantification of proliferation to invasion transition in tumor spheroids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["张少杰","尤欢欢","林 海","钱镶玉","何情祖","胡 桓","熊富海","曹玉萍","帅建伟"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560470400,"objectID":"29526636a7e96196a40cc7b717e0b178","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/163-classification_of_sleep_apnea_with_artificial_inte/","publishdate":"2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/163-classification_of_sleep_apnea_with_artificial_inte/","section":"publication","summary":"Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder associated with sleep, commonly known as sleep apnea syndrome, which affects about 4% of the general population.

Thus, it is important to develop methods to automatically classify sleep apnea. This paper introduces a variety of artificial intelligence classification methods of sleep apnea, including classification based on statistical rules and classification based on deep learning, and the analysis data can be single channel physiological data and multi-channel sleep data.

We observed that the inhibitory autapse can significantly enhance the signal propagation by the vibrational resonance, while the electrical and excitatory autapses typically weaken the signal transmission, indicating that the inhibitory autapse is more beneficial to transmit the rhythm of the pacemaker to the whole networks.

We investigated the effects of this microRNA on intestinal inflammation by studying mice with colitis.**Methods:** We obtained colon biopsy samples from 82 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 79 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 34 healthy individuals (controls) at Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital. MIR31- knockout mice and mice with conditional disruption of Mir31 specifically in the intestinal epithelium (MIR31 conditional knockouts) were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce colitis. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays to study proteins that regulate expression of MIR31, including STAT3 and p65, in LOVO colorectal cancer cells and organoids derived from mouse colon cells. Partially hydrolyzed alpha-lactalbumin was used to generate peptosome nanoparticles, and MIR31 mimics were loaded onto their surface using electrostatic adsorption. Peptosome-MIR31 mimic particles were encapsulated into oxidized konjac glucomannan (OKGM) microspheres, which were administered by enema into the large intestines of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.**Results:** Levels of MIR31 were increased in inflamed mucosa from patients with CD or UC, and from mice with colitis, compared with controls. STAT3 and nuclear factor-κB activated transcription of MIR31 in colorectal cancer cells and organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)6. MIR31-knockout and conditional-knockout mice developed more severe colitis in response to DSS and TNBS, with increased immune responses, compared with control mice. MIR31 bound to 3' untranslated regions of Il17ra and Il7r messenger RNAs (RNAs) (which encode receptors for the inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL7) and Il6st mRNA (which encodes GP130, a cytokine signaling protein). These mRNAs and proteins were greater in MIR31-knockout mice with colitis, compared with control mice; MIR31 and MIR31 mimics inhibited their expression. MIR31 also promoted epithelial regeneration by regulating the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 mimic microspheres localized to colonic epithelial cells in mice with colitis; they reduced the inflammatory response, increased body weight and colon length, and promoted epithelial cell proliferation.**Conclusions:** MIR31, increased in colon tissues from patients with CD or UC, reduces the inflammatory response in colon epithelium of mice by preventing expression of inflammatory cytokine receptors (Il7R and Il17RA) and signaling proteins (GP130). MIR31 also regulates the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways to promote epithelial regeneration following injury. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 microspheres localize to the colon epithelium of mice to reduce features of colitis. **Transcript Profiling:** GSE123556.","tags":[null],"title":"MicroRNA-31 Reduces Inflammatory Signaling and Promotes Regeneration in Colon Epithelium, and Delivery of Mimics in Microspheres Reduces Colitis in Mice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王抒伟","徐富献","钱镶钰","胡 桓","何情祖","林 海","帅建伟"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560211200,"objectID":"5e472c8315ec9be8db6f0eb5e7796d76","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/152-%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%AF%B9%E5%A4%9A%E5%AF%BC%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E5%9B%BE%E7%9A%84%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E5%88%86%E6%9C%9F%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/152-%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%AF%B9%E5%A4%9A%E5%AF%BC%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E5%9B%BE%E7%9A%84%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E5%88%86%E6%9C%9F%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/","section":"publication","summary":"传统上，自动睡眠分期是一项非常具有挑战性且费时费力的任务。大多数现有的自动睡眠分期方法都基于单通道的脑电(electroencephalography, EEG)数据，然而，这些方法忽略了医师从整体上观测多个通道EEG信号进行睡眠阶段评分的过程。为了解决这一问题，我们优化了数据结构，对医师的评分过程进行了详细的学习与建模，提出了一种基于多通道脑电图的自动睡眠评分法。我们介绍了在原始EEG与EOG样本上使用深度卷积神经网络(convolutional neural network, CNN)进行睡眠阶段评分的监督学习。该网络具有11层，每30 s的睡眠数据作为一个分期，并且不需要任何信号预处理或特征取。本文使用来自福建省某医院的EEG与EOG及专家评估的多导睡眠(polysomnography, PSG)数据对系统进行训练和评估。实验结果表明，在自动睡眠分期的研究中不应该忽略EOG数据。我们的系统性能与中级睡眠分期专家的结果相当。","tags":[null],"title":"应用深度神经网络对多导睡眠图的睡眠分期 研究","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sten Rüdiger","J.

We employ the hybrid model to investigate the evolution and growth dynamics of avascular invasive solid tumors under different chemotherapy strategies. Our simulations indicate that constant dosing is generally more effective in suppressing primary tumor growth than periodic dosing, due to the resulting continuous high drug concentration. In highly heterogeneous microenvironment, the malignancy of the tumor is significantly enhanced, leading to inefficiency of chemotherapies.

Various types of spiking patterns can be induced by the different external potassium accumulations in response to the stimulus, including two different types of epileptic seizure (SZ) and spreading depression (SD) states, two different mixed states of SD and SZ, SZ state with multi-burst, and tonic firing behaviors. Interestingly, we show that these rich spiking patterns can also be induced by the current stimulus with a low oxygen concentration. Furthermore, we reveal that the stimulus can induce two different phase transitions from the SD state to the SZ state according to the phase transition theory, which results in the different electrical activities.

Considerable progress has been made towards unraveling the constituents and the structure of the apoptosome as well as the mechanism of apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation. However, a significant gap remains in the understanding of this process, i.e., how seven Apaf-1·cytochrome c complexes stepwisely assemble into an apoptosome. Here, we construct a biophysical model that incorporates current biochemical knowledge about the formation of apoptosome.

In this paper we numerically discuss the properties of an anisotropic persistent random walk (APRW) model, in which two different and independent persistent times are assumed for cell migrations in the x- and y-axis directions. An intrinsic orthogonal coordinates with the primary and non-primary directions can be defined for each migration trajectory based on the singular vector decomposition method. Our simulation results show that the decay time of single exponential distribution of velocity auto-correlation function (VACF) in the primary direction is actually the large persistent time of the APRW model, and the small decay time of double exponential VACF in the non-primary direction equals the small persistent time of the APRW model.

TCSs generally consist of sensor histidine kinases (SKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Many SKs exhibit autokinase, phosphoryltransferase and phosphatase activities, which regulate RR activity through a phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle. However, how SKs perform different enzymatic activities is poorly understood. Here, several crystal structures of the minimal catalytic region of WalK, an essential SK from Lactobacillus plantarum that shares 60% sequence identity with its homologue VicK from Streptococcus mutans, are presented. WalK adopts an asymmetrical closed structure in the presence of ATP or ADP, in which one of the CA domains is positioned close to the DHp domain, thus leading both the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP/ADP to form hydrogen bonds to the ℇ- but not the δ-nitrogen of the phosphorylatable histidine in the DHp domain. In addition, the DHp domain in the ATP/ADP-bound state has a 25.7° asymmetrical helical bending coordinated with the repositioning of the CA domain; these processes are mutually exclusive and alternate in response to helicity changes that are possibly regulated by upstream signals. In the absence of ATP or ADP, however, WalK adopts a completely symmetric open structure with its DHp domain centred between two outward-reaching CA domains. In summary, these structures of WalK reveal the intrinsic dynamic properties of an SK structure as a molecular basis for multifunctionality","tags":[null],"title":"Conformational dynamics of the essential sensor histidine kinase WalK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fang Wei","Xiang Li","Meichun Cai","Yanping Liu","Peter Jung","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505088000,"objectID":"5cbec0f9c5267f50da67ed5ef2d02204","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/139-stress/","publishdate":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/139-stress/","section":"publication","summary":"Intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis are believed to be driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs).

To recognize a few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary regulatory functions, we constructed a computational model of miRNA-mediated feedforward loops (FFLs) in which a transcription factor (TF) regulates miRNA and targets gene. Based on the different dynamic interactions between miRNA and TF on gene expression, four possible structural topologies of FFLs with two gate functions (AND gate and OR gate) are introduced. We studied the dynamic behaviors of these different motifs. Furthermore, the relationship between the response time and maximal activation velocity of miRNA was investigated. We found that the curve of response time shows nonmonotonic behavior in Co1 loop with OR gate. This may help us to infer the mechanism of miRNA binding to the promoter region.

In this paper, in order to provide insights about the relation between the observed gating characteristics and the gating parameters in different IP3Rs, we apply the immune algorithm to fit the parameters of a modified DeYoung-Keizer model. By comparing the fitting parameter distributions of three IP3Rs, we suggest that the three types of IP3Rs have the similar open sensitivity in responding to IP3. The Oo-IP3R3 channel is easy to open in responding to low Ca2+ concentration, while Sf-IP3R channel is easily inhibited in responding to high Ca2+ concentration. We also show that the IP3 binding rate is not a sensitive parameter for stationary gating dynamics for three IP3Rs, but the inhibitory Ca2+ binding/unbinding rates are sensitive parameters for gating dynamics for both Oo-IP3R1 and Oo-IP3R3 channels. Such differences may be important in generating the spatially and temporally complex Ca2+ oscillations in cells.

In this paper we consider a puff model to study how the statistical properties of puffs are modulated by [Ca^{2+}]_{Basal}. The puff frequency and lifetime trivially increase with the increasing [Ca^{2+}]_{Basal}, but an unexpected result is that the puff amplitude and the maximum open-channel number of the puff show decreasing relationship with the increasing [Ca^{2+}]_{Basal}. The underlying dynamics is related not only to the increasing puff frequency which gives a shorter recovery time, but also to the increasing frequency of blips with only one channel open. We indicate that Ca^{2+} blips cause the channels to be inhibited and prevent their recovery during interpuff intervals, resulting in the suppressing effect on puff amplitudes. With increasing [Ca^{2+}]_{Basal}, more blips occur to cause more channels to be inhibited, leaving fewer channels available for puff events.

However, the detailed mechanism involved has not been fully elucidated. Owing to its importance in the regulation of Ca(2+) signaling, ER-mitochondrial distance in the neurons is tightly controlled in the physiological conditions. When the distance is decreased, Ca(2+) overload occurs both in the cytosol and mitochondria. The cytosolic Ca(2+) overload can (1) hyperactivate Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes, which in turn regulate activities of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and thereby resulting in the release of cytochrome c to activate caspase-3; (2) indirectly activate caspase-3 through the activation of caspase-12; and (3) promote the production and aggregation of β-amyloid. The three pathways eventually trigger neuronal apoptotic cell death. The mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload can lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species, inducing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and ultimately causing neuronal apoptotic and necrotic cell death. The resultant death of neurons which are responsible for memory and cognition would contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we propose that the reduction in the distance between ER and mitochondria may be implicated in AD pathology by enhanced Ca(2+) signaling, which provides a more complete picture of the Ca(2+) hypothesis of AD","tags":[null],"title":"Alzheimer’s disease via enhanced calcium signaling caused by the decrease of endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondrial distance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huang Yan-Dong","Li Xiang","Shuai Jian-Wei"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444521600,"objectID":"859b1be5efa44e575bc7a106941211c8","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/124-langevin/","publishdate":"2015-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/124-langevin/","section":"publication","summary":"The Langevin approach has been applied to model the random open and closing dynamics of ion channels.

In Shp2 knockout mice (SCSKO), a normal population of Sertoli cells was observed, but the blood-testis barrier (BTB) was not formed. Shp2 ablation initiated the untimely and excessive differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) by disturbing the expression of paracrine factors. As a consequence, the process of spermatogenesis was disrupted and the germ cells were depleted. Furthermore, Shp2 deletion impaired the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and failed to support the clonal formation of SSCs co-cultured with SCSKO Sertoli cells. As expected, Shp2 restoration largely restores the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and the clonal formation of SSCs. To identify the underlying mechanism, we further demonstrated that the absence of Shp2 suppressed Erk phosphorylation and thus, the expression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)- and testosterone-induced target genes.

A TCS typically comprises of a sensor histidine kinase (SK) with its cognate response regulator (RR), which often has two domains-N terminal receiver domain (RD) and C terminal effector domain (ED). The histidine kinase phosphorylates the RD to activate the ED by promoting dimerization. However, despite significant progress on structural studies, how RR transmits activation signal from RD to ED remains elusive. Here we analyzed active to inactive transition process of OmpR/PhoB family using an active conformation of RegX3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a model system by computational approaches. An inactive state of RegX3 generated from 150 ns molecular dynamic simulation has rotameric conformations of Thr79 and Tyr98 that are generally conserved in inactive RRs. Arg81 in loop β4α4 acts synergistically with loop β1α1 to change its interaction partners during active to inactive transition, potentially leading to the N-terminal movement of RegX3 helix α1. Global conformational dynamics of RegX3 is mainly dependent on α4β5 region, in particular seven 'hot-spot' residues (Tyr98 to Ser104), adjacent to which several coevolved residues at dimeric interface, including Ile76-Asp96, Asp97-Arg111 and Glu24-Arg113 pairs, are critical for signal transduction. Taken together, our computational analyses suggest a molecular linkage between Asp phosphorylation, proximal loops and α4β5α5 dimeric interface during RR active to inactive state transition, which is not often evidently defined from static crystal structures.","tags":[null],"title":"Conformational Dynamics of Response Regulator RegX3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenggui Yao","Zhiwei He","JinMing Luo","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1431302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1431302400,"objectID":"b114617560edcdae8358e6b8bdb86453","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/125-resonance/","publishdate":"2015-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/125-resonance/","section":"publication","summary":"The stimulus-dynamic response is an important topic in physics.

The potassium concentration in the interstitial space for each neuron is regulated by potassium currents, Na(+)-K(+) pumps, glial buffering, and ion diffusion. In addition to potassium diffusion, nearby neurons are also coupled through gap junctions. Our results reveal that the latency of the first spike responding to stimulus monotonically decreases with increasing gap-junction conductance but is insensitive to potassium diffusive coupling. The duration of network oscillations shows a bell-like shape with increasing potassium diffusive coupling at weak gap-junction coupling.

Our model predicts that there is a critical IP3R-MCU distance at which 50% of the ER-released Ca(2+) is taken up by mitochondria and that mitochondria modulate Ca(2+) signals differently when outside of this critical distance. This study highlights the importance of the IP3R-MCU distance on Ca(2+) signaling dynamics. The model predicts that when MCU are too closely associated with IP3Rs, the enhanced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake will produce an increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) spike amplitude. Notably, the model demonstrates the existence of an optimal IP3R-MCU distance (30-85 nm) for effective Ca(2+) transfer and the successful generation of Ca(2+) signals in healthy cells. We suggest that the space between the inner and outer mitochondria membranes provides a defense mechanism against occurrences of high [Ca(2+)]Cyt.

From the viewpoint of communication theory and engineering, molecular communication is proposed as a new paradigm for engineered biological nanomachines to communicate with the natural biological nanomachines which form a biological system. Distinct from the current telecommunication paradigm, molecular communication uses molecules as the carriers of information; sender biological nanomachines encode information on molecules and release the molecules in the environment, the molecules then propagate in the environment to receiver biological nanomachines, and the receiver biological nanomachines biochemically react with the molecules to decode information. Current molecular communication research is limited to small-scale networks of several biological nanomachines. Key challenges to bridge the gap between current research and practical applications include developing robust and scalable techniques to create a functional network from a large number of biological nanomachines. Developing networking mechanisms and communication protocols is anticipated to introduce new avenues into integrating engineered and natural biological nanomachines into a single networked system. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art in the area of molecular communication by discussing its architecture, features, applications, design, engineering, and physical modeling.

Elevations in Ca²⁺ concentration after intracellular release through IP₃ receptors (IP₃R) can either propagate in the form of waves spreading through the entire cell or produce spatially localized puffs. The appearance of waves and puffs is thought to implicate random initial openings of one or a few channels and subsequent activation of neighboring channels because of an \"autocatalytic\" feedback. It is much less clear, however, what determines the further time course of release, particularly since the lifetime is very different for waves (several seconds) and puffs (around 100 ms). Here we study the lifetime of Ca²⁺ signals and their dependence on residual Ca²⁺ microdomains. Our general idea is that Ca²⁺ microdomains are dynamical and mediate the effect of other physiological processes. Specifically, we focus on the mechanism by which Ca²⁺ binding proteins (buffers) alter the lifetime of Ca²⁺ signals. We use stochastic simulations of channel gating coupled to a coarse-grained description for the Ca²⁺ concentration. To describe the Ca²⁺ concentration in a phenomenological way, we here introduce a differential equation, which reflects the buffer characteristics by a few effective parameters. This non-stationary model for microdomains gives deep insight into the dynamical differences between puffs and waves. It provides a novel explanation for the different lifetimes of puffs and waves and suggests that puffs are terminated by Ca²⁺ inhibition while IP₃ unbinding is responsible for termination of waves. Thus our analysis hints at an additional role of IP3 and shows how cells can make use of the full complexity in IP₃R gating behavior to achieve different signals.","tags":[null],"title":"Termination of Ca²+ release for clustered IP₃R channels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.D.

Instead, we observed spontaneous and inositol trisphosphate (IP(3))-evoked Ca(2+) signals within TNTs between cultured mammalian cells, which sometimes remained localized and in other instances propagated as saltatory waves to evoke Ca(2+) signals in a connected cell. Consistent with this, immunostaining showed the presence of both endoplasmic reticulum and IP(3) receptors along the TNT.

We show that such a lifetime difference between puffs and waves can be understood with strongly reduced ordinary differential equations modified by a time-scale factor that takes into account the coupling strength of active and passive regions determined by the Ca2+ diffusion coefficient.

The intensity β of mortality selection has a nontrivial role in the evolution of both cooperation and network structure. At a defector's temptation b=1, the system gains its maximal cooperation level at β→∞. Increasing b decreases βmax for the maximal cooperation level. For network structure, the average degrees of strategists and the self-organization of clusters are investigated to understand the connections of strategists and their effects on cooperation level. Furthermore, we introduce the cooperating k-core to describe the tight level of the cooperator cluster. Cooperation is enhanced by forming a tight cooperating k-core at moderate β, but there is a collapse of the cooperating k-core when β is too large. The results indicate that cooperators outside the cooperating k-core play an important role in maintaining that core to ensure a high cooperation level. So the formation and maintenance of the cooperating k-core coordinate with each other at maximum cooperation level at a specific value of β.","tags":[null],"title":"Effect of mortality selection on the emergence of cooperation with network dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dong-Ping Yang","J.W.

Although the steady-state gating properties of the IP(3)R have been extensively studied and modeled under conditions of fixed [IP(3)] and [Ca(2+)], little is known about how Ca(2+) flux through a channel may modulate the gating of that same channel by feedback onto activating and inhibitory Ca(2+) binding sites. We thus simulated the dynamics of Ca(2+) self-feedback on monomeric and tetrameric IP(3)R models. A major conclusion is that self-activation depends crucially on stationary cytosolic Ca(2+) buffers that slow the collapse of the local [Ca(2+)] microdomain after closure. This promotes burst-like reopenings by the rebinding of Ca(2+) to the activating site; whereas inhibitory actions are substantially independent of stationary buffers but are strongly dependent on the location of the inhibitory Ca(2+) binding site on the IP(3)R in relation to the channel pore.","tags":[null],"title":"Modeling Ca21 Feedback on a Single Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor and Its Modulation by Ca21 Buffers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["YANG Dong-Ping","Hai Lin","WU Chen-Xu","SHUAI Jian-Wei"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1244678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1244678400,"objectID":"20df8742d0e8ab5d0c41365780bc1f30","permalink":"https://jianweishuai.github.io/groupweb/publication/88-modelling-moran/","publishdate":"2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/groupweb/publication/88-modelling-moran/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a simple model based on the Moran process with network dynamics.

Using high-resolution confocal linescan imaging and a sensitive Ca(2+) indicator dye (fluo-4-dextran), we show that puffs are often preceded by small, transient Ca(2+) elevations that we christen \"trigger events\". The magnitude of triggers is consistent with their arising from the opening of a single IP(3) receptor/channel, and we propose that they initiate puffs by recruiting neighboring IP(3)Rs within the cluster by a regenerative process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. Puff amplitudes (fluorescence ratio change) are on average approximately 6 times greater than that of the triggers, suggesting that at least six IP(3)Rs may simultaneously be open during a puff. Trigger events have average durations of approximately 12 ms, as compared to 19 ms for the mean rise time of puffs, and their spatial extent is approximately 3 times smaller than puffs (respective widths at half peak amplitude 0.6 and 1.6 micro m). All these parameters were relatively independent of IP(3) concentration, although the proportion of puffs showing resolved triggers was greatest (approximately 80%) at low [IP(3)]. Because Ca(2+) puffs constitute the building blocks from which cellular IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals are constructed, the events that initiate them are likely to be of fundamental importance for cell signaling. Moreover, the trigger events provide a useful yardstick by which to derive information regarding the number and spatial arrangement of IP(3)Rs within clusters.","tags":[null],"title":"‘Trigger’ Events Precede Calcium Puffs in Xenopus Oocytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianwei Shuai","Heather J.

Important questions remain as to the number of IP(3)Rs that open during a puff, their spatial distribution within a cluster, and how much Ca(2+) current flows through each channel. The recent discovery of \"trigger\" events-small Ca(2+) signals that immediately precede puffs and are interpreted to arise through opening of single IP(3)R channels-now provides a useful yardstick by which to calibrate the Ca(2+) flux underlying puffs. Here, we describe a deterministic numerical model to simulate puffs and trigger events. Based on confocal linescan imaging in Xenopus oocytes, we simulated Ca(2+) release in two sequential stages; representing the trigger by the opening of a single IP(3)R in the center of a cluster for 12 ms, followed by the concerted opening of some number of IP(3)Rs for 19 ms, representing the rising phase of the puff. The diffusion of Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-bound indicator dye were modeled in a three-dimensional cytosolic volume in the presence of immobile and mobile Ca(2+) buffers, and were used to predict the observed fluorescence signal after blurring by the microscope point-spread function. Optimal correspondence with experimental measurements of puff spatial width and puff/trigger amplitude ratio was obtained assuming that puffs arise from the synchronous opening of 25-35 IP(3)Rs, each carrying a Ca(2+) current of approximately 0.4 pA, with the channels distributed through a cluster 300-800 nm in diameter.","tags":[null],"title":"The Number and Spatial Distribution of IP3 Receptors Underlying Calcium Puffs in Xenopus Oocytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.W.

Most work on the modeling of brain functions is based on the modelling of neuronal networks. The vast majority of cells in the brain, however, are nonneuronal cells or glial cells; about 90% of all brain cells are glial cells. Among the several types of glial cells, the astrocytes are known to carry out many important functions; several of them in interactions with neurons. The chapter highlights that astrocytes listen to neuronal chatter at the synapses and in turn can modulate neuronal dynamics at the same synapse or over some distance. As neurons fire, glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft that is partially lined by the metabotropic glutamate receptors of the synaptic astrocytes. Upon binding of glutamate to the astrocyte, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) is released into the intracellular space. IP3 in turn binds to the IP3 receptor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Ca2+ is released from the ER into the cytosol. As described in more detail below, such Ca2+ release can occur in forms of intracellular Ca2+ waves. The Ca2+ wave can propagate across the cell membrane, through the extracellular space into adjacent astrocytes. Elevated Ca2+ concentrations in synaptic astrocytes generate extracellular glutamate that can modulate the neuronal synapse by generating additional inward currents. The chapter also reviews recent progress in mathematical modeling of intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ signaling in general, and in the context of astrocytes and their control of synaptic plasticity.","tags":[null],"title":"Mathematical modeling of intracellular and intercellular calcium signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

This unidirectional signal coupling also provides a minimum information flow from the driving system to the response system.

Such optical approaches have advantages over electrophysiological single-channel techniques in that they are less invasive, provide spatial information and can simultaneously and independently monitor hundreds of channels. However, their kinetic resolution does not yet approach that of patch-clamp recordings. To help understand the processes that determine the temporal resolution and noise level of single-channel Ca(2+) fluorescence signals (SCCaFTs), we simulated the microdomains of Ca(2+) ions and Ca(2+)-bound indicator dye that exist around the mouth of an open channel. Further, as an aid to development of improved optical techniques, we modeled the dependence of the amplitude and kinetics of SCCaFTs on parameters such as the imaging volume, the indicator concentration, affinity and mobility, and the presence of endogenous and exogenous Ca(2+) buffers. The results indicate that under optimal conditions, including the use of confocal or total-internal reflection microscopy to image from sub-femtolitre volumes, SCCaFTs should resolve channel openings as brief as 1ms with a signal-to-noise ratio \u003e10.","tags":[null],"title":"Optical single-channel recording by imaging Ca2+ flux through individual ion channels: theoretical considerations and limits to resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

For such an attractor, the time interval of continuously positive finite-time Lyapunov exponent must be smaller than the period of the driving stimulus, although it has a long-time positive tail. The intermittency between laminar and burst behavior is a characteristic dynamic of the strange nonchaotic attractors. Simulation results show that the chaotic phase occurs only within a small region around the origin in the parameter space. More than half of the large nonchaotic region is the strange nonchaotic phase. The chaotic phase is typically surrounded by strange nonchaotic attractors.
