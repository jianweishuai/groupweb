abstract: The Langevin approach has been applied to model the random open and closing dynamics of ion channels. It has long been known that the gate-based Langevin approach is not sufficiently accurate to reproduce the statistics of stochastic channel dynamics in Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Here, we introduce a modified gate-based Langevin approach with rescaled noise strength to simulate stochastic channel dynamics. The rescaled independent gate and identical gate Langevin approaches improve the statistical results for the mean membrane voltage, inter-spike interval, and spike amplitude.
